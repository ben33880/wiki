__Note :__ This how-to is only validated for a Linux installation.


## Prerequisites

Before strating the procedure, you should :

* Have a version of DomoticZ 2021.1 at least.
* Be on plugin's __Stable5__ branch. Command `git checkout stable5` if needed.
* Have the latest version of the plugin. Command `git pull` if needed.


## Backup

Even if the procedure has been tested several times, things may not go as planned.
It is recommended to make a full backup so that you can go back if necessary.
Remember to save :

* DomoticZ
* The plugin's data
* The operating system


## Procedure

* Open the terminal
* Stop DomoticZ. The command is usually : `sudo service domoticz.sh stop`
* Go in the plugin directory. The command is usually `cd domoticz/plugins/Domoticz-Zigate/`
* Run the command : `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/zigbeefordomoticz/Domoticz-Zigbee`
* Install the necessary Python packages with the command : `sudo pip3 install voluptuous pycrypto aiosqlite crccheck pyusb attrs aiohttp pyserial-asyncio`
* Run the commande `sudo chown -R pi:pi .` (attention to take the dot at the end). If needed, replace __pi:pi__ accordingly to the __user:group__ that you are using.

During the time of the development phase, it is necessary to move on to the new beta6 branch : `git checkout beta6`

* Install the missing Python libraries with the command : `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* Make the __plugin.py__ file executable with the command : `sudo chmod +x plugin.py`
* Restart DomoticZ. The command is usually : `sudo service domoticz.sh start`


Normally, the name of the plugin in hardware has become __ZigBee for DomoticZ__.

From now on, the term ZiGate is replaced by __coordinateur__, more generic.

If you already have a plugin configured with a ZiGate as coordinator, you don't have to do anything : the plugin should continue to work normally.


## Settings

There are 4 possible coordinator models:

* ZiGate : no changes to the existing plugin.
* ZiGate + : no changes to the existing plugin.
* ZiGate (via zigpy) : the plugin communicates with the ZiGate through zigpy libraries. It's only experimental and won't be supported.
* Texas Instruments ZNP : for new TI Brand Coordinators.



## IMPORTANT Plugin's update

The `git pull` is no longer sufficient, it is now necessary to make the command `git pull --recurse-submodules`.
